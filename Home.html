                Alright, so you wanna go play games on the school computers by using your pc/laptop at home? 
                Well if you are going to, you are definitely going to need some basic things at least 
                which I will list below later.

                Using Chrome remote desktop is something you would need to install on yor computer.
                But to use it effectively you would need good internet and some other things. 
                There are many things you would be able to do with Chrome remote desktop, like
                playing games, checking something running on your computer etc. You could play
                anything installed on your computer. You would also be able to get files on your 
                computer to the device you would be using with chrome remote desktop. Also, it is 
                impossible for the school (<img src="./images/Icons & Emojis/Heathland-logo.png" class="emoji"/>) 
                to know what games, websites or whatever you are doing unless they can see your screen, 
                which does actually happen due the program they use to take control of your screen.
